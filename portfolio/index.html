				<h5 class="text-thin">It has begun...</h5>
				<p>I've been working on web development for a little while now and I'm really enjoying the work. Aside from projects I've been assigned I've been working on a few for myself. I figured that any experience I got doing this sort of work is useful. I'm trying a few of the techniques in the personal projects that I've seen in the classes but haven't used for this particular project. All of my various projects, both assigned and personal will me posted on this site along with better descriptions and notes. This in the simple start to a very interesting path.</p>

		      	<h2>First Time for Everything</h2>
		      	<p>This is the first time I did anything serious with HTML/CSS. I've played with it enough but I'd never built a major project using it. I built the page with the first real utilization of JavaScript. I'd done some very basic JS-based graphics, but it was interesting being in this situation. After banging my head into the wall enough times figuring out the path to take; and using a lot of salty language when talking to something that (I hope) can't hear me, I finally finished. I had the distinct feeling that I was insane while I screamed "It's Alive!" Actually, I did that silently. My wife and mother-in-law might have thought I'd lost my mind if I really did that, though my toddler-age son would probably find it very funny. There's a chance that they'd be right, but I don't want to give them any more ideas than neccessary.</p>
		      	<p>This spot can be filled buy any number of projects through the Udacity classes, and I expect it to be filled in such a way with the next set of projects after this one</p>

		      	<h2>Dylan's Website</h2>
		      	<p>This is a project that is still ongoing. It's almost exclusively based around photos of my son. What parent doesn't have dozens of picturs of their child? I decided that it would be a good way to get more practice, without a preplanned design and without client or deadline. As you can imagine, since it's mostly practice it's still under construction. I spend what free time I have working on it. Free time is wedged between the work I do on programming courses and the time I spend with my son. The largest reason I continue on this project is that I can put any new knowledge I gain to use in it, and any failure is minor and doesn't have a major impact on anything else.  I have a design completed and I'm currently building the guts of the site now.</p>
